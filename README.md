0+x test task

Work in progress(!!!)

What's done:
1) Use  Jetpack Compose
- Reduce boilerplate code
- Haven't worked with it befor(+ new experience/ no commercial exp.)
- Easy working with save state when the configuration changes
2) Use Hilt
- Before work only with Dagger2(+ new exp/ no commercial exp.)
- Easier, Faster, more Beatiful
3) ViewModel
- MVVM's architecture which promote Google
- Prefect fit with Jetpack COmpose

What's need to improve:
- Design. App's pretty ugly
- Make network calls more elegant
- Unit tests
- Add Pagination

P.S.
