### 0+x test task

The goal of this task is to develop a small application
using https://newsapi.org API RESTful services.

### Application
We would like you to build a small application that
accomplishes the following objectives:
1. The main screen should load news sources and will then
present the following information. You may use any layout.
a. Source title
b. Description
c. URL
2. When a user taps on any source within the previous screen
the app should proceed to step 3.
3. The user should see list of articles with the following
info:
a. Article title
b. Article description
c. Article thumbnail
d. Article author
e. Article published day

### Mobile Developer Assignment 2
Procedure
1. Get your API Key as explained within the documentation
https://newsapi.org.
2. Use Android Studio or XCode and share the project via email
or via GitHub.
3. Write a few sentences (max. 10) about your approach,
reasoning and send it with your solution.
4. You can use third party libraries with their preferences to
handle dependencies.
5. Take the opportunity to showcase your coding style and use
whatever design pattern (MVC, MVVM, etc) you would
normally have used for this kind of task.

### Additionally you can do the followings:
1. Adapt UI to device orientation changes.
2. Pagination or load more for the article list.
3. Functional programming.
4. Unit Testing.

:dizzy: Work in progress(!!!) :dizzy:

### What's done:
1) Use  Jetpack Compose
- Reduce boilerplate code
- Haven't worked with it before. New experience&
- Easy working with save state when the configuration changes
2) Use Hilt
- Before work only with Dagger2(raw). New experience&
- Easier, Faster, more Beautiful
3) ViewModel
- MVVM's architecture which promote Google
- Prefect fit with Jetpack Compose
4) Landscapist (Glide+Compose)
- https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist
- Helps to work with Glide in Jetpack Compose
- Use Glide because I have worked with it before
5) Paging 3
- Best practice for work with Jetpack Compose and coroutines
- I have no experience in it before

### What's need to improve:
- Design. App's pretty ugly
- Unit tests

P.S.
Cool rebranding!!!
