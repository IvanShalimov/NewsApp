Work in progress(!!!)

What's done:
1) Use  Jetpack Compose
- Reduce boilerplate code
- Haven't worked with it before(+ new experience/ no commercial exp.)
- Easy working with save state when the configuration changes
2) Use Hilt
- Before work only with Dagger2(+ new exp/ no commercial exp.)
- Easier, Faster, more Beautiful
3) ViewModel
- MVVM's architecture which promote Google
- Prefect fit with Jetpack Compose
4) Landscapist (Glide+Compose)
- https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist
- Helps to work with Glide in Jetpack Compose
- Use Glide because I have worked with it before

What's need to improve:
